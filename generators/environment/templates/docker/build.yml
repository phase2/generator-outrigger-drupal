# Build and command-line operations containers for your local environment.
#
# By setting your local DOCKER_ENV environment variable you can spin up
# multiple environments. Keep in mind you should also vary the docker-compose
# --project-name as needed by running commands with that flag, the -p alias,
# or setting the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable.
