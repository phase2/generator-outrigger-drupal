##
# Operational services to run the application in your local or Outrigger Cloud environment.
#
# To ensure this works as expected for multiple environments, both environment
# settings must be carefully respected in *every* command invocation:
#
# * The `DOCKER_ENV` environment variable which is used as a template parameter for
#   how this configuration is used.
# * The -p|--project-name option for Docker Compose, which uses the provided name
#   in lieu of deriving key Docker namespacing from whatever the current directory
#   happens to be named. You can also set the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable.
#
# Warning: Multiple environments for local use require customizing the DNSDock
# Configuration. A generic approach for this has not yet been determined.
